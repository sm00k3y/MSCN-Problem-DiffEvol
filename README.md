# Multi-echelon Supply Chain Network (MSCN)

## Short introduction

MSCN Problem is a practical problem in administrating big organizations. It deals with planning deliveries of materials from suppliers to factories, from factories to distribution centers and from distribution centers to points of sell.

Solution to such problem needs to **maximize profit**, **minimize delivery cost** and satisfy particular constraints (eg. one supplier cannot deliver more material than he can produce).

## Solution itself

To create such solution, using easy optimalization algorithms is not enough. For this program, a **Differential Evolution** algorithm was developed as well as Random Search, to compare results. All results and solutions are stored in .txt files to allow for easy tests and comarison between many different test cases.

## Licence

Instruction for this problem was created by dr inż. Michał Przewoźniczek and development of the project has been overseen at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
